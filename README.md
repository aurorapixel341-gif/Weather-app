#The Lume – Weather Application

The Lume is a modern, React-based weather platform designed to provide users with clear, accurate, and real-time weather information through a visually polished interface. The project focuses on simplicity, fast data delivery, and user-friendly navigation while offering multiple weather-related features in one place.
Project Description
The Lume delivers complete weather insights for any city in the world. Users can search a city manually or allow the system to detect their current location using geolocation. The interface presents detailed weather data—including temperature, humidity, wind speed, air quality alerts, and more—while remaining clean, minimal, and easy to understand.
The application also includes additional sections such as clothing suggestions based on temperature, an interactive live map for visual weather tracking, and information pages like About, Services, and Contact. It brings together multiple weather tools into a single cohesive platform.

#What the Application Does?

1. Fetches Real-Time Weather Data
The Lume connects to the OpenWeatherMap API to show:
Current temperature
Weather conditions
Humidity
Wind speed
Pressure
Location-specific weather details
Users can search by city or allow the app to detect their current location.
2. Shows Hourly Forecast
The hourly forecast section displays:
Weather for the next 8 hours
Temperature changes
Wind speed (converted to km/h)
Humidity
Weather icons for visual clarity
3. Displays a 5-Day Forecast
A separate component provides a summarized, daily forecast for the upcoming 5 days.
Each card includes:
Day name
Temperature
Weather condition
Icon
This allows users to plan ahead easily.
4. Provides Clothing Suggestions
Based on the current temperature, the app suggests what a user should wear:
Warm clothes for cold weather
Light clothes for mild temperatures
Very light/cotton clothes for hot conditions
This makes the experience more practical and user-focused.
5. Interactive Map View
The integrated Windy map provides:
Live temperature overlays
Wind patterns
Interactive zoom, drag, and location viewing
City-level weather visualization
This gives users a global view of weather conditions beyond their city.
6. Additional UI Pages
The project includes structured pages to complete the user experience:
About Page – Introduces the team and the purpose behind The Lume
Contact Page – Form, social links, and embedded location
Services Page – Timeline-style listing of key weather services
Terms & Conditions – Informative policy page
Login & Register Pages – UI-only authentication screens
These pages make the app feel complete and ready for real-world use.
7. Dashboard & Home Experience
The Landing and Dashboard pages visually introduce:
The Lume’s purpose
Feature highlights
User testimonials
Weather tips and insights
Guided navigation to services
This gives users a smooth entry point into the system.


#Overall Purpose

The Lume aims to be a single, clean, and reliable weather companion that balances design, accuracy, and usability.
It is built to demonstrate:
Practical API integration
UI/UX design skills
Component-based React structure
A complete multipage weather platform
